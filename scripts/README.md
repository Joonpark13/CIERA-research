# Analysis Scripts

## `neutron_stars.py`

`neutron_stars.py` contains two functions, `get_single_data` and `get_binary_data`.
These functions parse the data from the quest output files and returns the relevant
data (see source for specific descriptions). The module itself can be run as a script,
which will produce (two) corresponding plots of neutron star count vs. physical time
in the simulation.
